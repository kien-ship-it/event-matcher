# Event Matcher: Development Plan

This document outlines the phased development plan to build and launch the Event Matcher application using Vercel and Supabase.

**Version:** 1.2  
**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Estimated Timeline:** 20-22 weeks (5-5.5 months)

### **Methodology**

*   **Agile Framework:** The project will be developed using an Agile approach, broken down into two-week sprints.
*   **Sprints:** Each sprint will have a clear goal, a set of features (user stories) to be completed from the backlog, and a sprint review to demonstrate progress.
*   **Definition of Done:** Features must be coded, tested, code-reviewed, and deployed to staging before considered complete.
*   **Tools:**
    *   **Version Control:** Git, hosted on GitHub with branch protection rules.
    *   **Project Management:** GitHub Projects or Linear for backlog management and sprint tracking.
    *   **Communication:** Slack or Discord for team communication.
    *   **Design:** Figma for UI/UX wireframing and mockups.
    *   **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript for code consistency.
    *   **Testing:** Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E tests.

## **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup (Sprint 0 - 1 Week)**

This is a "sprint zero" focused on setting up the entire development environment and infrastructure before feature development begins.

**Goal:** Create a stable foundation for the project.

| Epic | Key Tasks (User Stories) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Project Initialization** | 1. Set up GitHub repository with branch protection and PR templates. <br> 2. Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript using `create-next-app`. <br> 3. Configure ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript strict mode. <br> 4. Integrate shadcn/ui component library with Tailwind CSS. <br> 5. Set up project structure (app/, components/, lib/, types/). |
| **Infrastructure Setup** | 1. Create a new Supabase project (production and staging). <br> 2. Design and implement the initial PostgreSQL database schema with RLS policies. <br> 3. Create database migration scripts using Supabase CLI. <br> 4. Set up environment variables management (.env.local, .env.example). <br> 5. Create a new Vercel project and link it to the GitHub repository. |
| **CI/CD Pipeline** | 1. Configure Vercel for automatic deployments from `main` (production) and `develop` (staging) branches. <br> 2. Set up GitHub Actions for automated testing on PRs. <br> 3. Configure preview deployments for all PRs. <br> 4. Push the initial Next.js app to GitHub and confirm successful deployment. |

**Outcome:** A "Hello World" Next.js app with TypeScript is live on Vercel (production and staging), the Supabase database is structured with RLS policies, and CI/CD pipeline is functional.

**Key Deliverables:**
