# Recurring Events Bug Fix - Summary

## Problem
The create new event popup in the admin panel was not displaying recurring events of participants in the availability heatmap. Only one-off events within the specified date range were being shown.

## Root Cause
The `getEventsForUsers` function in `/lib/api/events.ts` was filtering ALL events (including recurring ones) by the `start_time` and `end_time` columns. This approach doesn't work for recurring events because:
- A recurring event's `start_time` might be outside the query range
- But instances of that recurring event might fall within the range
- The expansion logic needs to run client-side to determine which instances are relevant

## Solution

### 1. Updated Event Fetching Logic (`/lib/api/events.ts`)
Modified `getEventsForUsers` to:
- Fetch ALL recurring events (without date filtering)
- Fetch only one-off events within the date range
- Combine both result sets

This allows the client-side expansion logic to properly determine which recurring event instances fall within the specified range.

### 2. Enhanced Recurring Event Expansion (`/lib/utils/recurring.ts`)
Updated the `generateRecurringInstances` function to handle both:
- **Availability table format**: Uses `day_of_week` field (single day weekly recurrence)
- **Events table format**: Uses `recurrence_pattern` JSONB field (supports multiple patterns)

Added support for:
- Weekly recurrence with multiple days of the week
- Daily recurrence with custom intervals
- Exception dates from both sources
- Recurrence end dates

### 3. Created Availability Aggregation Utilities (`/lib/utils/availability-aggregation.ts`)
New helper functions for better code organization:
- `exportParticipantAvailability()`: Exports availability data for each participant
- `aggregateAvailability()`: Aggregates participant availability into 15-minute slots

These functions can be used for:
- Individual participant analysis
- Bulk availability exports
- Testing and debugging

### 4. Added Debug Logging
Added console logging in `AvailabilityHeatmap.tsx` to track:
- Number of events fetched
- Count of recurring vs one-off events
- Number of expanded event instances

## Files Modified

1. **`/lib/api/events.ts`**
   - Updated `getEventsForUsers()` function
   - Now properly fetches recurring events

2. **`/lib/utils/recurring.ts`**
   - Added `RecurrencePattern` interface
   - Updated `generateRecurringInstances()` to handle both table formats
   - Updated `getNextOccurrence()` to support recurrence patterns
   - Updated `countOccurrences()` function signature

3. **`/components/events/AvailabilityHeatmap.tsx`**
   - Added date range validation
   - Added debug logging for event fetching and expansion

4. **`/lib/utils/availability-aggregation.ts`** (NEW)
   - Created helper functions for availability export and aggregation

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin selects participants and date range** in the event creation dialog
2. **System fetches events**:
   - All recurring events for selected participants (no date filter)
   - One-off events within the date range
3. **Client-side expansion**:
   - Recurring events are expanded into individual instances
   - Only instances within the date range are kept
   - Exception dates and recurrence end dates are respected
4. **Display in heatmap**:
   - Expanded events shown as red blocks (busy times)
   - Availability shown as green/blue gradient (based on participant count)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a recurring event for a participant (e.g., weekly meeting every Monday)
2. Open the event creation dialog in admin panel
3. Select that participant
4. Choose a date range that includes future Mondays
5. Verify that all Monday instances appear as red blocks in the heatmap

## Future Enhancements

Consider adding:
- Monthly recurrence support (currently supports daily and weekly)
- Better error handling for malformed recurrence patterns
- UI to show which events are causing busy times on hover
- Export functionality to download participant availability as CSV/JSON
