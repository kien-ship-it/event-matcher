title: dayMaxEvents

In, **dayGrid** view, the max number of events within a given day, not counting the +more link. The rest will show up in a popover.

Just like with [dayMaxEventRows](dayMaxEventRows), if `true` is specified, the number of events will be limited to the height of the day cell.

For **timeGrid** and **timeline** views, see [eventMaxStack](eventMaxStack).
