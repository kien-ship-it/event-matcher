title: stickyHeaderDates

Whether to fix the date-headers at the top of the calendar to the viewport while scrolling.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
`'auto'` (the default), `true`, `false`
</div>

The default value of `'auto'` will look at the [height](height) setting and if it is `'auto'`, meaning the calendar has the potential to be very tall, sticky-header-dates will be activated.

The following demos show sticky date-headers:

- [timegrid view](sticky-timegrid-demo)
- [list view](sticky-list-demo)
- [timeline view](sticky-timeline-demo)
- [vertical resource view](sticky-resource-timegrid-demo)
