FullCalendar Premium (also known as "FullCalendar Scheduler") is a collection of plugins released under a [different license](/license) than the standard plugins. Each plugin offers additional functionality:

- [Timeline View](timeline-view) - display a large number of resources, with dates/times spanning horizontally
- [Vertical Resource View](vertical-resource-view) - display resources as columns
- [Print Optimization](print) - improve how your calendar looks when printed

A Premium plugin is initialized in the same way a typical standard plugin would be initialized:

- [**NPM/Yarn instructions**](initialize-es6#premium-plugins)
- [**ZIP archives and CDN links**](initialize-globals#premium-bundle)
