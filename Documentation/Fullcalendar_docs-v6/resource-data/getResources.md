title: getResources
type: method
---

A method that retrieves all [Resources](resource-object), including children, as a single flat list.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
.getResources()
</div>

If you want to retrieve a list of *top-level* resources (resources that are not children of any other resource), then use [getTopLevelResources](getTopLevelResources) instead.
