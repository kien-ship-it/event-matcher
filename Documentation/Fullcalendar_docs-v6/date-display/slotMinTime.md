Determines the first time slot that will be displayed for each day.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
[Duration](duration-object), default: `"00:00:00"`
</div>

The default `"00:00:00"` means the start time will be at the very beginning of the day (midnight).

Determines the first time slot, even when the scrollbars have been scrolled all the way back.
