[Multi-Month Grid](multimonth-grid) will not allow each mini-month to be become smaller than this pixel value.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Number, *default*: `350`
</div>

If the available width requires each mini-month to become smaller than this pixel value, the mini-months will wrap to subsequent rows instead.
