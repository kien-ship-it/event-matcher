To let the user make selections by clicking and dragging, the `interaction` plugin **must be loaded** and this option must be set to `true`.

The [select](select-callback) and [unselect](unselect-callback) callbacks will be useful for monitoring when selections are made and cleared.

To learn the ways in which selections can be cleared, read the docs for the [unselect](unselect-callback) callback.

## Loading the Interaction Plugin

You must load the interaction plugin in order for `selectable` to work. You can do this with [and ES6 build system](initialize-es6):

```js
import { Calendar } from '@fullcalendar/core';
import interactionPlugin from '@fullcalendar/interaction'; // for selectable
import dayGridPlugin from '@fullcalendar/daygrid'; // for dayGridMonth view
...
let calendar = new Calendar(calendarEl, {
  plugins: [ interactionPlugin, dayGridPlugin ],
  initialView: 'dayGridMonth',
  selectable: true
});
...
```

Alternatively, you can use [a global bundle](initialize-globals):

```html
<script src='fullcalendar/dist/index.global.js'></script>
<script>
...
var calendar = new FullCalendar.Calendar(calendarEl, {
  initialView: 'dayGridMonth',
  selectable: true
});
...
</script>
```
