Whether to draw a "placeholder" event while the user is dragging.

<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
Boolean, *default*: `false`
</div>

**This option only applies to the TimeGrid views.**

A value of `true` will draw a "placeholder" event while the user is dragging (similar to what Google Calendar does for its week and day views). A value of `false` (the default) will draw the standard highlighting over each cell.
