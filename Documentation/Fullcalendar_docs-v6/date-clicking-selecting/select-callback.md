<div class='spec' markdown='1'>
function( *selectionInfo* )
</div>

`selectionInfo` is a plain object with the following properties:

<table>

<tr>
<th>start</th>
<td markdown='1'>
[Date](date-object). A date indicating the beginning of the selection.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<th>end</th>
<td markdown='1'>
[Date](date-object). A date indicating the end of the selection.

In line with the discussion about the [Event object](event-parsing), it is important to stress that the `end` date property is **exclusive**. For example, if the selection is all-day and the last day is a Thursday, `end` will be Friday.
